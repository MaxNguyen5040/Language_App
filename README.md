# Language_App

I've always wanted to learn a new language like Spanish, but have found online versions too fast-paced and reliant on visual pictures. I thought it would be super cool to make a simple UI that allowed users to review and really master the terms they were learning! 

I also added dictionary import functionality - so any language could be learned! 

Development Progress:
 - I've gotten most of the foundation of the app set!

Future Steps:
 - My next step will be using Python libraries like the dictionary or translation APIS to bring in way more data for users to learn from.
 - The website UI definetly is a bit rough - looking to improve this with some animations!
